This repository is dedicated for the development of an Evidence storage website and is intended to serve as an academic project. Here, the general public can upload images/videos/audio files etc. of crimes they witness which will then be made available to authorities in-charge of the investigation (Police & Law Enforcement officials). This project is aimed to harmonize and foster public-law enforcement interaction, transparency, awareness and accountability.

This website has been deployed to GitHub Pages. You will find the website under the **_Environments_** section on the right.
